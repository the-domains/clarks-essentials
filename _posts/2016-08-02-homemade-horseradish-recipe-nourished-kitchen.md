  Homemade horseradish found its way to our table this week, and it's hot -
  painfully hot, pleasurably hot, perfectly hot. When fresh horseradish root
  appears at market, which is rarely, I fight my way to it - elbowing into the
  stand before the other Weston A Price Foundation and fermentation enthusiasts
  in my community can beat me to the precious, potent and gnarled roots.
