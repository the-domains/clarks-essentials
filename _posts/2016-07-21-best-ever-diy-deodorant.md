# Best Ever DIY Deodorant!

Ooh, I am excited to share with you...the best homemade do-it-yourself (DIY) deodorant ever!!! I am actually surprised that I make & use it...but I tell you what, I am totally converted & will not be returning to that shop bought stuff again...

When I first started out on this journey to wellness, I found numerous suggestions about giving up on shop bought deodorant as it is full of aluminium and chemicals that are toxic to the body - in all honesty I thought NOOOO, I can't give up on my 48 hour antiperspirant - I hate bad smells & the thought of having underarm body odour (BO) made me think very hard about giving this a try. So anyway, I vigilantly used up the supply I had of the shop bought spray & roll-on deo _(umm, saving a spray can just in-case)_, I made some homemade deo. I used it everyday, I was so paranoid about BO that I went to the toilet often at the office so that I could check if I had pit stink or not. I did this for a couple of days & was really very surprised at the "lack of stink"... thoughts of "I am turning into a hippy" - whereas in reality, I was just going about life as usual.

**Please do give this DIY deodorant a try**, it is amazingly effective even in the high temperatures of summer. A slight word of warning...after about 2 weeks I got a strange rash under one of my armpits...there is much research out there from others that have gone 'natural', that some detox of the area will occur and the baking soda can irritate the skin during this time. I gave it a rest for a few days using just fractionated coconut oil and a special skin clearing blend of essential oils. Once my skin healed & the rash went away I started using this deodorant again. I've had no problems or looked back since!

OK, so to the recipe....

**Ingredients:**

1/4 cup baking soda  
1/4 cup arrowroot powder  
5 tablespoons virgin coconut oil_(the solid white stuff at room temperature)_  
15-20 drops total of your desired essential oil (eo) or combination of eo's_(recommended is 15 drops but I like a little stronger fragrance so I use a few more)_  
optional - 1 teaspoon of powdered rose petals_(this is what made my deodorant pink in colour)_, I use this as I love the smell of rose, but do not have rose oil as it is very expensive. If you do have rose oil, 1 or 2 drops included in your total eo drops would be perfect!  
_NOTE: if you live in a very warm climate you can add some shea or cocoa butter to the mix to help keep it more solid._

**Method:**

Put the baking soda, arrowroot & coconut oil in a bowl. Use a spoon to mix and 'squash' the coconut oil into the powders to make a thick paste_(If the oil is too cold it will be very solid, may be better if it is heated a little first)_. Add your desired essential oils and mix well, transfer into an airtight glass jar/container or a BPA free plastic deodorant stick container.

**To use:**

From jar _(as I do),_ dip in your clean fingers, take a small amount & rub into the skin of your armpits after a shower/bath or whenever you please. Enjoy the natural fragrance & the bonus being stink free!

_NOTE - this is a deodorant not an antiperspirant. Your armpits are designed to sweat (as gross as that is), but I notice the arrowroot does help a little with keeping wetness at bay, the coconut oil & some eo's have some natural antibacterial properties that help to keep BO stink at bay._
