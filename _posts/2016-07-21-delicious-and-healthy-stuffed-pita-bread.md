Ever gone to the kitchen, opened the fridge & just stood in front of the cold opening just staring at the contents blindly thinking "I have nothing to eat!"....? Well that was me the other day, it was ridiculous...

There was loads of food in the fridge, the issue was I had to prepare it...yet, I wanted to eat then & there. After a few more thoughts and sub-thoughts, I reigned myself in & got to thinking what to put together for dinner. The following stuffed pita bread recipe is what I decided on making with the ingredients to hand. I decided to use pork as it is what I had in the freezer, but it would be ideal also with chicken or any other meat you desire. To be honest you could omit the meat and go veggie. The photo's were taken as I went along, certainly not professional by any means, but they give you an idea.

So, to the recipe...

_This recipe is for 2 people but can be easily increased to 4 by doubling the amount_

**Ingredients:**

pack of 4 pita bread _(wholemeal is my preferred)_  
100g cherry tomatoes, quartered  
1 clove of garlic finely chopped  
small pack of feta cheese _(approx. 150g)_  
1 small red onion sliced  
2 heads of cos lettuce  
fresh parsley  
150ml natural unsweetened yoghurt  
1 lime _(zested & juiced)_  
pork fillet  
salt, black pepper & olive oil

**Method:**

Heat the oven to 200Â°C. Prepare all ingredients...halve pita bread & open the 'pocket'; wash cherry tomatoes & quarter; take the skin off the garlic & chop finely; wash lettuce leaves, slice into thin strips; peel onion, halve & slice finely; cut the feta into 8 slices approx. 1cm thick; finely slice/chop parsley; remove excess fat from the meat & cut into 1cm cubes.
![prepare all ingredients. I cut my feta a bit thin, so there were a few morsels I could eat while preparing :)](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d78bc474-84c3-48fc-a899-7751b0fe16f8.jpg)

Heat fry pan to med-high heat, put in about a teaspoon of olive oil & fry meat for 3-5 minutes stirring to brown on all sides - season with salt & pepper if you choose to. Remove the cooked meat from the pan and set aside in a bowl.

Put the fry pan back on the stove _(turn heat down a little) _with a dash more olive oil then fry the tomatoes & garlic for ~3mins, stir to ensure the garlic doesn't burn. Take off the heat & mix with the cooked meat.

Now prepare your pita's by, holding one in your hand, put in a big spoon of the tomato & meat mixture & place a slice of feta inside on top...do the same for all of the pita halves and place onto a baking tray lined with baking paper.

Put the baking tray in the preheated oven for 7-10 minutes so the pita's warm and crisp up a little. Take out of oven & cool for a while.  
The salad can be prepared while the pita's are in the oven. Mix the juice of half the lime, 2 tbsp olive oil, salt & pepper. Combine the lettuce, onion & parsley in a bowl, pour over the lime dressing & toss well. Put the yoghurt in a small bowl and mix in the zest of the lime, the juice from the other half of the lime, salt & pepper to taste.

**Serve** by adding the prepared salad to the cooked stuffed pita bread and top with the yoghurt dressing. Remaining salad can also be served as a side dish. **ENJOY!!!**
