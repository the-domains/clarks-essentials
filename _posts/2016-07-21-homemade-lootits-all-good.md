# Homemade Loot...it's all good!
![Can't spell...oh well, will have to correct it with next batch!](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/53fc4d29-02bc-477c-afc5-396636aafc74.jpg)

There is some amount of great satisfaction in knowing that you made something; that what you have made is from natural organic and easily sourced materials and most importantly it is free from many of those unpleasant toxins and chemicals found in many commercial store bought products.

I have recently been participating in an online aromatherapy course, as well as researching like a crazy woman about making homemade DIY products for cleaning the house, body and general natural solutions for life. The picture above is the fruit of my recent learnings and efforts. I aim to post the individual recipes in the very near future so please keep coming back or sign up to follow my blog and you will receive notifications when they are posted :-) .

I have chosen to use more of a natural approach to life in general for many reasons such as:

* to improve overall health for myself and my husband _(you know...trying to curb or put a halt to the poor lifestyle habits we have gotten ourselves into over the last years - those one that put you at high risk for many of the mental and physical illnesses out there! Those things that diminish your quality of life...)_
* improve nutrition - going for more of a wholefood approach, some elements of paleo...reducing the intake of processed foods like white flour, sugar etc...
* Improve sleep...fertility...and the list goes on...

Don't get me wrong, I am all for modern medicine - it has its place but does tend to aim mainly for diagnosis and treatment. I wanted to look into this journey as one of wellness...working to a lifestyle change. Educating myself, becoming more self-aware and aiming for prevention of disease. Trust me this is a great challenge for my beliefs, thoughts, feelings & habits. It is making me think seriously about the choices I am making in almost every aspect of my life. So I suppose you could say I am looking to the journey to wellness as one that is integrated....using traditional and non-traditional practices to treat the body, mind & spirit all at the same time. The body does have the ability to heal itself _(within reason)_ with the right tools and support. I firmly believe that learning what the body needs and restoring this will help with continued healing and overall wellness.

I have started this journey not just making lifestyle changes, using/consuming more organic natural products & foods, but also using essential oils. I was quite skeptical at first regardless of knowing that plant remedies are often used and have been used for thousands of years to help the body heal itself. I found a brand of essential oils that are of high quality, that I trust. They have been tested & certified as genuine, pure and potent for therapeutic use. I have wholeheartedly embraced using essential oils, they have helped me in amazing ways in supporting my emotional and physical self. I use them topically, aromatically & internally by using them to enhance the air I breathe, skin care, all manner of cleaning, cooking _(wow!... it's amazing, the difference it makes adding it in some of the typical dishes I make)_...I have even used them to help my cat!

I realise _(after all these years)_ that my health ultimately rests in my hands, that all the choices I make affect my health & know that I have the power to live a life of optimal health. My goodness, sounds like I have turned into a "hippy"... well trust me I haven't...I am no angel & I still make many of the wrong choices, but I am constantly learning...

So...welcome to my journey & the beginning of I am not sure what...... Well, at least you will be able to get some great recipes and links to other blogs that I love and follow too...'til next time xxx
