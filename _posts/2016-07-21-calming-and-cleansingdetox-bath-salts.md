Here is an alternative to my Lavender Relaxing Bath Salts....  
This one is divine in smell... both Men and Women like this one - yes, it is a little more flowery but the delightful benefits are one to be enjoyed by all.

You too can make some fabulous & therapeutic bath salts...add your favourite essential oil_(s)_, rest back and soak in the delights!

**Detox - Calming & Cleansing **_**(also relaxing) **_**Bath Salts:**

**What you need:**  
- 2-3 cups Epsom salts _(I actually used 3 cups... but a good general rule is 2 parts epsom and sea salt to 1 part baking soda)_  
- 2 cups Sea Salt _(I used Dead Sea salt)_  
- 1 cup baking soda  
- 1 tbsp ground rose petals  
- 12 drops therapeutic grade lavender essential oil  
- 8 drops therapeutic grade geranium essential oil  
- 2-3 drops therapeutic grade rose essential oil _(ensure it is pure essential oil and not an oil that is diluted in another carrier oil like jojoba etc..)_  
- dried lavender flowers & rose petals/buds _(optional for decoration)_

**Method:**  
Add all dry ingredients to a bowl and stir/mix thoroughly. Add in the lavender essential oil stirring the mix well.  
Decant into your choice of container.  
Add 1-3 handfuls into a full bath of warm water...mix in to dissolve. Jump in bath lay back, relax and let your worries slip away for 20mins.  
Epsom salt baths are known to relieve stress and pain, help muscles and nerves to function properly, and relieve constipation. They are also great for the skin!

...The addition of **Lavender Essential Oil** will support you to relax and wind down which will hopefully bring on a fabulous sleep_ðŸ˜Š_.

...The health benefits of **Geranium Essential Oil** can be attributed to its properties as an astringent, haemostatic, cicatrisant, cytophylactic, diuretic, deodorant, styptic, tonic and more... It is often widely used in aromatherapy for its many health benefits; like its ability to balance hormones, depression, relieve stress and reduce inflammation/irritation, improve the health of the skin, alleviate the effects of menopause, improve circulation, possibly boost kidney health, and reduce blood pressure.

...Roses are often considered the most beautiful flowers in the world. The benefits of **Rose Essential Oil**_(I prefer oil from "Rosa Damascena" as it smells totally divine) _can be connected with properties such as an antiseptic, antiviral, antidepressant, antiphlogistic, antispasmodic, aphrodisiac, astringent, bactericidal and many more... to be honest, I don't care much about its properties - I just love the smell!!!! If there are benefits - that is just a bonus!

> All I can say is the combination of these oils is SOOOOO GOOD!!! Makes me feel relaxed, calm, chilled and happy, with the added bonus of less muscle aches & pains.

Seriously, give this a go...make some...you know you want to; let me know what you think!
