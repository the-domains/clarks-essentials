You too can make some fabulous & therapeutic bath salts...add your favourite essential oil(s), rest back and soak in the delights!

**Lavender Relaxing Bath Salts**

**What you need:**  
- 3 cups Epsom salts  
- 2 cups Sea Salt _(I used Dead Sea salt)_  
- 1 cup baking soda  
- dried lavender flowers _(optional)_  
- 5 to 20 drops therapeutic grade lavender essential oil _(depending how strong you like it...note use less oil if this is for children)_

**What to do:**  
Add all dry ingredients to a bowl and stir/mix thoroughly. Add in the lavender essential oil stirring the mix well.  
Decant into your choice of container.  
Add 1-3 handfuls into a full bath of warm water...mix in to dissolve. Jump in bath lay back, relax and let your worries slip away for 20mins.  
Epsom salt baths are known to relieve stress and pain, help muscles and nerves to function properly, and relieve constipation. They are also great for the skin! The addition of lavender will support you to relax and wind down which will hopefully bring on a fabulous sleep_ðŸ˜Š_
